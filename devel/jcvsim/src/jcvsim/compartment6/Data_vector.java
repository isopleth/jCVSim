     * N_X is the number of relevant pressures in the cardiovascular system. It

     * external bias pressures. N_X determines the size of the pressure vector x
     * and the vector of the pressure derivatives dxdt. N_C is the number of
     * contracting cardiac chambers in the model. It determines the size of the
     * arrays c and dcdt which contain the values of the time-varying
     * compliances
     * and their derivatives, respectively. N_T determines the size of the time
     * vector. It currently consists of 6 entries. Absolute time, cardiac time
     * (i.e. time elapsed since the onset of the last atrial contraction), are
     * the
     * first two entries. The next three entries are PR_delay, Tasys, and Tvsys.
     * The last entry is "absolute modified time" which is used in the tilt()
     * and
     * lbnp() routines (see those routines for the definition of this time
     * variable). The tilt array stores the blood volume loss in the 0 component
     * and the carotid sinus offset pressure in the 1 component.
